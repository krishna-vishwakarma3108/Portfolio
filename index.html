        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Krishna Vishwakarma, currently pursuing a B. Tech in Computer Science Engineering from Sushila Devi Bansal College of Technology, Indore. I am skilled in C, C++, HTML, CSS, and UI/UX design. My journey into the world of design started with a fascination for how technology can be seamlessly integrated into everyday life, enhancing user experiences.

            As a passionate UI/UX designer, I am interning at Cognifyz Technologies, where I've had the opportunity to work on various exciting projects. Collaborating with talented teams, I develop solutions that not only meet but exceed user expectations. My experience here has honed my skills in design thinking, user research, and prototyping using tools like Figma.</p>

            <h2>Tic Tac Toe</h2>
            <p>Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid where players take turns placing X or O in empty cells. The goal is to be the first to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. The game promotes strategic thinking and pattern recognition. It is easy to learn, making it a popular introductory game for children and a common exercise in programming for learning basic algorithms.</p>
